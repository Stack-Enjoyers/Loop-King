# Loop King
Are you ready to fight for a better day?

The people of Looptopia have suffered under the tyranny of the Loop Queen. You are a master engineer, whose newest weapon of destruction will put an end to this battle: a car, a Loop's biggest weakness.

You must dodge your enemies, and do sick donut drifts to reach never-before-seen speeds, on your way to victory to liberate the people of Looptopia from the ferocious grasp of the Loop Queen.

Will you save these people, and be the Loop King they always deserved? Are you ready for the greatest Loopty Loop of your life?
